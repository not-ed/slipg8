About
</h1>

SLIPG8 is a frantic 2D arcade platformer about navigating around rapidly changing gameplay modifiers against a constantly depleting timer. It was based on a [Ludem Dare](https://ldjam.com/) theme that ultimately did not make it past the final stages of voting the particular contest it was considered for (The theme being 'Into the unknown'). The game itself features 6 different gameplay modifiers as its central mechanic, with up to 3 being active at any given time assuming the player is able to make it far enough in a single run, as well as a local high score counter which keeps track of a player's best run between gameplay sessions.
